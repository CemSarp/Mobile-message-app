# Mobile-message-app

This was the project that i have built for my CS310(mobile application) class at SabancÄ± University.
It uses mongoDB as its database.

This app succesfully makes user registration and login using JWT. 

In the app you are able to send friend requests with their usernames. You can accept or reject the friend request.

You can send real time messages to your friends. You can also create groups with your friends and also make group messaging.
